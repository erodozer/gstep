A self-serving research project into recreating stepmania in Godot Engine.  I've always been fascinated with Stepmania/DDR, but the codebase itself is riddled with legacy and the scale of it all is daunting.  By building according to the gameplay specifications, and learning how to parse the documented file formats used by the game, this project hopes to distill things down to the core of what defines the rhythm game and its data types.

Components in this repo are organized and available for reuse in other projects that wish to use rhythm game mechanics, especially projects that desire to leverage the Stepmania format and editor to easily create content.

## Compatibility
